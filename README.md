TASK ACHIEVED:

    1. Read the data from the weather.dat file
    2. Calculate the temperature spread for each day
    3. Get the maximum spread and day of the month

Assumptions Made:

    1. Code to be view on developing IDE using JDK 1.7 and 1.8 JDK
    2. The weather.dat file to be located in the project folder
    3. The executable jar will remain the dist folder during execution
    4. The asterisk in the values 32* and 97* removed using regex to eliminate the error: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "97*"
    5. The file name and extension (weather.dat) to be maintained for the file to be scanned

How to run the application:

    Requirements:
    > JDK/JRE 1.7 and above
    > JAVA_HOME environment variable set on OS (Linux/Windows) test: on terminal/commandline type "java -version"

    1. Windows
    > Navigate to the project directory on file explorer
    > double click the "fileScanner.bat" or on command line type "start fileScanner.bat"

    2. Linux
    > On Terminal navigate to the project directory.
    > grant execution privileges to file "fileScanner.sh": command: "chmod +x fileScanner.sh"
    > commands available "start:
    > then, type "./fileScanner start"
